# Portfolio of Blue Team Investigations

This repository showcases a series of practical cases I've worked through, involving open-source intelligence (OSINT), digital forensics (DFIR), malware analysis, reverse engineering and other blue team (defensive) challenges. Each case focuses on structured analysis, real-world tools, and professional reporting. Cases are split into two categories: public and private. Public ones are self-explanatory. Private cases contain writeups of materials that are forbidden by the content owners to be publicly shared at the time. These writeups will be made public as soon as they are allowed. Until then, I can only present the private writeups in person.

# Disclaimer on Redactions and Sensitive Information

To comply with fair use, platform terms of service, and content licensing:

- Certain sensitive content (e.g. VirusTotal hashes, flags, MITRE IDs, exact answers, proprietary screenshots) has been redacted or blurred.

- Answers to questions are sometimes presented within analytical interpretations, not labeled explicitly, to maintain educational integrity without disclosing protected content.

# Proof of Authenticity

Although some material is redacted, I can privately demonstrate that I personally completed all challenges:

- I can log into the original platform (e.g. CyberDefenders) and show challenge completions.
- I can provide a live demo on my Kali Linux VM used for solving the labs.
- I can show the VM snapshots I took during the solving of some challanges.

All writeups are based solely on my own work and analysis.

This approach aims to balance transparency, professionalism, and legal/ethical boundaries.
